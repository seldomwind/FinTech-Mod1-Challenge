## Overview and Origin

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitcoin  started the wave of cryptographic currencies on Jan. 3 2009. Once an obscure form of currency gaining notoriety in such things as the "Silk Road" and being heralded as an untraceable currency. Few understood what this new technology would have to offer us in the future.  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies has now gained momentum producing yield farming, NFTs, safe-havens, and more. With it's deployment of Decentralized Applications it is quickly disrubting Fintech as we know it.
Input Output Hong kong(IOHK) now under the name Input Output Global (IOG) is the focus of our case study. IOG was Incorporated in 2015 by Charles hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. The idea behind IOG began with Co-founder Charles Hoskinson having a disagreement with Vitalik Buterin and the board of Ethereum(ETH) on how to govern their cryptocurrency and corporation.  Having to make a difficult business diecision between a Non-Profit organization (NPO) and For profit organization with a seperate entity to the CryptoCurrency, Charles  decided on for profit while most of the board decided on a ICO. Taking information that he had gathered by Co-founding  ETH and what he had seen deployed with Bitcoin Hoskinson along with Wood began creating Cardano(ADA) and it's support corporation IOG through private funds stated to have been made from investing in ETH and BTC in it's earlier years. In 2017 IOG began an ICO which resulted in $62.2 million in funding. They now currently operate has a blockchain infrastructure research and engineering company that produces revenue through goverment, private sector, and ADA's project catalyst.

## Business Activities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to IOG global's website their mission statement is "We view the world as a series of giant and mostly interconnected social graphs with hundreds of complex systems embedded. Our mission is to perturb the graphs to a more connected, transparent and fair configuration for both the flow of ideas and value. It is the founding principle of IOHK. Cascading disruption is the idea that most of the structures that form the world’s financial, governance and social systems are inherently unstable and thus minor perturbations can cause a ripple effect that fundamentally reconfigures the entire system. Our company is committed to identifying and developing technology to force these perturbations in order to push towards a more fair and transparent order."
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IOG is attempting to offer stability in regions suffering economically and socially through solutions built on ADA. Due to termoil in the Region it is difficult to maintain health, bank, and even school records. The main Goal of the IOG team since inception has been targeted at Goverment's and citizen's of the African continent.  Currently The totality of Africa's GDP is Approximatley  $2.6 Trillion, The World Econmic Forum In 2020 stated that by 2025 we could see that rise to $5.6 Trillion. If IOG is able to tap into this expanding market they will have a substanial revenue for many years to come. Towards this goal IOG has deployed various partnerships with companies to help make headway into this region. One such example comes from an article on unlock-bc.com "Input Output  part of IOHK Cardano blockchain platform and World Mobile Group have partnered to democratize access to digital, financial and social services in Africa through its Blockchain digital identity solution Atala Prism. The start will be in Zanzibar and greater Tanzania. The companies aim to bring sustainable internet connectivity using renewable, solar-powered energy. Together, the companies will provide affordable network nodes, based on the Cardano blockchain infrastructure, to local business owners. These network nodes act as local relays for internet connectivity. Subscribers to these networks will be able to access Input Output’s digital identity solution, Atala Prism, which will allow them to use services such as digital banking, healthcare and education.  In Africa alone, more than 700 million people, which is more than half of the population, are not connected to the Internet. Most mobile networks haven’t invested in the infrastructure to reach them. This often excludes Africans from accessing basic services such as education, banking, or healthcare. Through this partnership, Input Output and World Mobile Group go the extra mile to reach these communities, with the vision to bring everyone, everywhere online, with secure, user-controlled ID’s allowing users to better access essential services. " No other company is currently offering Banking, Identity, Medical Records, School Records all on one platform to the African Goverment and it's Citizens.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atala prism, Cardano, Daedelus are the main driving technologies in IOG's back pocket. Atala prism implements Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credential(VC) as it's main source of information.  Through API's it updates and scans the network for any relavent information to the DID's connected to the VC.  daedaluswallet.io gives us a run down of what features the wallet offers "Daedelus wallet Daedalus is a full node wallet. Daedalus downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. That way you get maximum security and completely trustless operation, without centrally hosted 3rd party servers." Cardano offers smaller fees per transaction than most of it's competitors and  second layer solution allowing soft forks within the cardano network to facilitate any scalibility issues. The netwrok is built upon a Proof of stake concept Where the enviromental damadge is minimized. All of Cardano's code is peer reviewed and tested before realese, in it's almost 15 years of deployment it has not suffered any hacks and even has a Bug bounty of up to $20,000 for those who can find issues within the code. Finally EUTxO, helps deal with impertinent loss offering an attractive deal to people day trading or wanting to sell their assest with as little slippage as possible.

# Landscape

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IOHK is in the blochain and Cryptocurrency doomain They have seen multiple ICO's, the start of Futures Trading, NFTs, Bank settlements and stable coins, Staking, Crypto assest loans,  and Several DEX rollouts. Binance, Coinbase, Ethereum Switzerland Gmbh or ETH, Open Coin, and Kraken are some of the major companies in the current domain.  


# Results

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking companies in this domain have a tendancy to view sucess through the price of the underlying assest or by it's Markey cap. Cardano currently ranks 4th as a cryptocurrency if you exclude tether and USD coin (stable coins). Considering these metrics ADA is doing very well for there being a downturn in the market sentiment. IOHK whose most outspoken member is Hoskinson does not tend to measure their success by the valuation or market cap of the coin and has even questioned why it is valued as high as it was during its peak.  IOHK has maintained it's decentralized nature by having over 3000 validators, currently has a contract with Ethopian goverment and is working on expanding it's influence throught South Africa, has never been hacked, and hasn't rolled out new developments without first ensuring that it is functional. Considering that it has steadily been delivering on it's promises though somewhat late is a major plus.  ETH(2nd largest crypto) still remains above Cardano being it's closest rival though they do have focuses on different projects.

## Recommendations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see more involment in South America. With Presidents such as Nayib Armando Bukele Ortez of El Salvador heralding Bitcoin, I believe that there can be a great benefeit of introducing the technology at a Govermental and citizen level. Colombia is a prime example of an area where there is lack of organization on many levels. They currently do not have an affordable Multiple Listing Service (MLS) as we do in the united states, so most people have to view inventory through private websites or go door to door to find housing options. The political and civil turmoil sometimes experienced at different periods make record keeping and tracking difficult. Through the cardano platform a Dapp can be developed to provide an similar MLS experience or better. Partnering with the goverment could establish NFT's as deeds to help maintain reliability in the record keeping. Sometimes it is difficult for Realtors in Colombia to even recieve the percentage of pay owed to them. the commision fee could be split from the NFT and not allow for registration of the change of ownership until the amount due to the reltor is paid or simply be put into a smart contract for when the finalization of the deal is done the funds get distributed to each party. Provided just one service that might facilitate the lives of people in South america would open a door into dealings with other countires that want to expand technology to it's citizenry. South America's 2021 GDP was 2.8 Trillion, through blockchain IHOK Could help facilitate stability in other regions than just Africa and still enter in to an arena where they could produce revenue. Decentralization, taking away power from the centralized authorities helps to alleviate corruption. These technologies would help these burdened countries improve quality of life for its citizens.
